# plane-alert-db


This project consists of lists of 'interesting' aircraft, formatted as CSV files. The list is designed to work with the excellent **https://github.com/kx1t/docker-planefence** . 

*Please only suggest/make any changes to plane-alert-db.csv on github - all other files (except PIA) are generated from this file, and if you do not make your changes there they will be overwritten and lost

# Current Content

# Planefence

The list takes the form 

- $ICAO,$Registration,$Operator,$Type,$ICAO Type,#CMPG,$Tag 1,$#Tag 2,$#Tag 3,Category,$#Link

e.g 502C5C,YL-KSH,Baltic Bees display team,Aero L-39 C,L39,Civ,Do A Barrel Roll,Display Team,,Aerobatic Teams,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Bees_Jet_Team

To use this list with Planefence, simply configure your planefence.config setup to include the following line:

- PF_ALERTLIST=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sportsbadger/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-db.csv

If you want to add the list in addition to your local plane-alert-db.txt list, you can do the following:

- PF_ALERTLIST=plane-alert-db.txt,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sportsbadger/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-gov.csv,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sportsbadger/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-pol.csv

**Note -- the priority of use is first-to-last, so if you want your local list to be interpreted first, move it to the front of the list**

Add these characters to the column headers to control the behavior of PlaneAlert

- "$" \- Tweet this column as #hashtag
- "#" \- Don't show on the website (it will ignore this for the ICAO field, which is always shown)
- "$#"\- Don't show on the website, tweet as a #hashtag

# Disclaimer, excuses and dodges

This is not intented to be a definitive list, especially when it comes to aircraft models. Where the same model of aircraft is made by several manufacturers I wont always have the correct one. If you thought it was a Beechcraft King Air 200 and actualy it was a Textron Super King Air B200GT I won't be losing any sleep. There are other data sources (see below) if you want absolute accuracy. 

# Data Sources

This data has been gathered from far too many sources to mention, but some sites have been *really* useful.
