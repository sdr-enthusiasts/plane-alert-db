# plane-alert-db <!-- omit in toc -->

This project consists of lists of 'interesting' aircraft, formatted as CSV files. The list is designed to work with the excellent **<https://github.com/kx1t/docker-planefence>**.

> **Warning**
> Please only suggest/make any changes to the [plane-alert-db.csv](plane-alert-db.csv), [plane-alert-twitter-blocked.csv](plane-alert-twitter-blocked.csv), [plane-alert-pia.csv](plane-alert-pia.csv), [plane-alert-ukraine.csv](plane-alert-ukraine.csv) and [plane_images.txt](plane_images.txt) files on GitHub - all other files (except PIA) are generated from this file, and if you do not make your changes there, they will be overwritten and lost.

## Current Content

There currently are about **12848** unique aircraft in **49** categories found in this repository. This [Dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/eb19ab53-b622-4946-b34a-9667232c136d/page/4taCC) contains details of the main list and the most recent additions.
These aircraft are divided into five main databases:

- [plane-alert-db.csv](plane-alert-db.csv) - A list of interesting aircraft with tags, categories and links. (12848)
- [plane-alert-pia.csv](plane-alert-pia.csv): A list that contains PIA planes. (52)
- [plane-alert-twitter-blocked.csv](plane-alert-twitter-blocked.csv): A list of aircraft that will cause your Twitter account to be banned when used with `docker-planefence`. **Please use it with care**. (9)
- [plane-alert-ukraine.csv](plane-alert-ukraine.csv): A list with Ukrainian planes. (24)
- [plane_images.txt](plane_images.txt): A accompanying list that contains aircraft images. (12881)

Based on these main databases, several derivative databases are created using a [GitHub action](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/actions/workflows/create_db_derivatives.yaml):

- [plane-alert-civ.csv](plane-alert-civ.csv) - Civilian Registered Aircraft, includes Historic and Distinctive. (3310)
- [plane-alert-mil.csv](plane-alert-mil.csv) - Military Only. (7065)
- [plane-alert-pol.csv](plane-alert-pol.csv) - Police Forces. (862)
- [plane-alert-gov.csv](plane-alert-gov.csv) - Governments, Gov Agencies and Dictators. (1590)

A second version of each of the above lists contains up to 4 image links per aircraft. These lists are created in [GitHub action](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/actions/workflows/create_db_derivatives.yaml) using the [plane_images.txt](plane_images.txt) database. **Please consider this experimental, do not come to rely on any of the image links**

- [plane-alert-db-images.csv](plane-alert-db-images.csv)
- [plane-alert-twitter-blocked-images.csv](plane-alert-twitter-blocked.csv)
- [plane-alert-ukraine-images.csv](plane-alert-ukraine.csv)
- [plane-alert-civ-images.csv](plane-alert-civ-images.csv)
- [plane-alert-mil-images.csv](plane-alert-mil-images.csv)
- [plane-alert-pol-images.csv](plane-alert-pol-images.csv)
- [plane-alert-gov-images.csv](plane-alert-gov-images.csv)

This [Dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/eb19ab53-b622-4946-b34a-9667232c136d/page/4taCC) contains details of the main list and the most recent additions.

## Description of Categories

Think of categories like groups, with similar or related aircraft listed together. This allows you to easily select a subset of the list for your own use. The category names (and tags) come from my rather idiosyncratic sense of humour. If you have better suggestions I'm all ears.

## Planefence

The list takes the form:

| $ICAO  | $Registration | $Operator                | $Type                | $ICAO Type | #CMPG | $Tag 1           | $#Tag 2      | $#Tag 3    | Category        | $#Link                                               |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ----- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 502C5C | YL-KSH        | Baltic Bees display team | Aero L-39C Albatross | L39        | Civ   | Do A Barrel Roll | Display Team | Aerobatics | Aerobatic Teams | <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Bees_Jet_Team> |

To use this list with Planefence, configure your `planefence.config` setup to include the following line:

```config
PF_ALERTLIST=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sportsbadger/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-db.csv
```

If you want to add the list in addition to your local plane-alert-db.csv list, you can do the following:

- PF_ALERTLIST=plane-alert-db.csv,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sportsbadger/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-gov.csv,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sportsbadger/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-pol.csv

**Note -- the priority of use is first-to-last, so if you want your local list to be interpreted first, move it to the front of the list**

Add these characters to the column headers to control the behaviour of PlaneAlert

- `$` \- Tweet this column as #hashtag.
- `#` \- Don't show on the website (it will ignore this for the ICAO field, which is always shown).
- `$#` \- Don't show on the website; tweet as a #hashtag.

## Contributing

As [explained above](#current-content), this repository contains five main databases to which people can contribute. The other databases are created automatically using [GitHub action](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/actions/workflows/create_db_derivatives.yaml). As a result, please only suggest/make any changes to these main databases. Changes made to all other CSV files will be overwritten and lost.

## Disclaimer, excuses and dodges

This is not intended to be a definitive list, especially when it comes to aircraft models. Where the same model of aircraft is made by several manufacturers I won't always have the correct one. If you thought it was a Beechcraft King Air 200 and actually it was a Textron Super King Air B200GT, I won't be losing any sleep. There are other data sources (see below) if you want absolute accuracy.
