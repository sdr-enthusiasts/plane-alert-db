# plane-alert-db <!-- omit in toc -->

This project consists of lists of 'interesting' aircraft, formatted as CSV files. The list is designed to work with the excellent **<https://github.com/kx1t/docker-planefence>**.

> **Warning**
> Please only suggest/make any changes to the [plane-alert-db.csv](plane-alert-db.csv), [plane-alert-pia.csv](plane-alert-pia.csv), [plane-alert-ukraine.csv](plane-alert-ukraine.csv) and [plane_images.csv](plane_images.csv) files on GitHub - all other files (except PIA) are generated from this file, and if you do not make your changes there, they will be overwritten and lost. Additionally, it is **not recommended** to edit the CSV files in Microsoft Excel, as Excel will attempt to "fix" some ICAO hexes and other fields. It's better to use a code editor such as VS Studio Codeâ€”you can access the web version of Code by pressing the period key . when viewing the file you wish to edit.

## Current Content

There currently are about **13340** unique aircraft in **55** categories found in this repository. This [Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/46ff4328-09d3-4e65-ab5a-bd2ba27a18fd/page/4taCC) contains details of the main list and the most recent additions.
These aircraft are divided into four main databases:

-   [plane-alert-db.csv](plane-alert-db.csv) - A list of interesting aircraft with tags, categories and links. (13242)
-   [plane-alert-pia.csv](plane-alert-pia.csv): A list that contains PIA planes. (55)
-   [plane-alert-ukraine.csv](plane-alert-ukraine.csv): A list with Ukrainian planes. (32)
-   [plane_images.csv](plane_images.csv): A accompanying list that contains aircraft images. (10557)

Based on these main databases, several derivative databases are created using a [GitHub action](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/actions/workflows/create_db_derivatives.yaml):

-   [plane-alert-civ.csv](plane-alert-civ.csv) - Civilian Registered Aircraft, includes Historic and Distinctive. (3310)
-   [plane-alert-mil.csv](plane-alert-mil.csv) - Military Only. (7065)
-   [plane-alert-pol.csv](plane-alert-pol.csv) - Police Forces. (862)
-   [plane-alert-gov.csv](plane-alert-gov.csv) - Governments, Gov Agencies and Dictators. (1590)

A second version of each of the above lists contains up to 4 image links per aircraft. These lists are created in [GitHub action](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/actions/workflows/create_db_derivatives.yaml) using the [plane_images.csv](plane_images.csv) database. **Please consider this experimental, do not come to rely on any of the image links**

-   [plane-alert-db-images.csv](plane-alert-db-images.csv)
-   [plane-alert-ukraine-images.csv](plane-alert-ukraine.csv)
-   [plane-alert-civ-images.csv](plane-alert-civ-images.csv)
-   [plane-alert-mil-images.csv](plane-alert-mil-images.csv)
-   [plane-alert-pol-images.csv](plane-alert-pol-images.csv)
-   [plane-alert-gov-images.csv](plane-alert-gov-images.csv)

Note, we used to create a seperate list, `plane-alert-twitter-blocked.csv`, for use with Planefence's Twitter posting functionality. This list would prevent certain aircraft from being posted to Twitter in an attempt to keep the posting bot account from being banned. Since Twitter has now made it all but impossible for users to make bots for free, we've stopped creating this list. 

This [Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/46ff4328-09d3-4e65-ab5a-bd2ba27a18fd) contains details of the [main](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/blob/main/plane-alert-db.csv) and [Ukraine](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/blob/main/plane-alert-ukraine.csv) lists.

## Description of Categories

Think of categories like groups, with similar or related aircraft listed together. This allows you to easily select a subset of the list for your own use. The category names (and tags) come from my rather idiosyncratic sense of humour. If you have better suggestions I'm all ears.

## Planefence

The list takes the form:

| $ICAO  | $Registration | $Operator                | $Type                | $ICAO Type | #CMPG | $Tag 1           | $#Tag 2      | $#Tag 3    | Category        | $#Link                                               |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ----- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 502C5C | YL-KSH        | Baltic Bees display team | Aero L-39C Albatross | L39        | Civ   | Do A Barrel Roll | Display Team | Aerobatics | Aerobatic Teams | <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Bees_Jet_Team> |

To use this list with Planefence, configure your `planefence.config` setup to include the following line:

```config
PF_ALERTLIST=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-db.csv
```

If you want to add the list in addition to your local plane-alert-db.csv list, you can do the following:

```config
PF_ALERTLIST=plane-alert-db.csv,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-gov.csv,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-pol.csv
```

> **Note**
> The priority of use is first-to-last, so if you want your local list to be interpreted first, move it to the front of the list.

Add these characters to the column headers to control the behaviour of PlaneAlert

-   `$` - Tweet this column as #hashtag.
-   `#` - Don't show on the website (it will ignore this for the ICAO field, which is always shown).
-   `$#` - Don't show on the website; tweet as a #hashtag.

## Contributing

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/issues) if you have ideas on improving this repository or want to report a bug! All contributions are welcome ðŸš€. Please consult the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. You can also check out the [TODOS](TODOS.md) page if you want to contribute to this repository but need some ideas.

> **Warning**
> As also [explained above](#current-content), this repository contains four main databases to which people can contribute. The other databases are created automatically using [GitHub action](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/plane-alert-db/actions/workflows/create_db_derivatives.yaml). As a result, please only suggest/make any changes to these main databases. Changes made to all other CSV files will be overwritten and lost. Additionally, it is **not recommended** to edit the CSV files in Microsoft Excel, as Excel will attempt to "fix" some ICAO hexes and other fields. It's better to use a code editor such as VS Studio Codeâ€”you can access the web version of Code by pressing the period key . when viewing the file you wish to edit.

If you're creating a pull request with additions, please add them to the end of the file. We may sort the list periodically to group like planes together.

## Disclaimer, excuses and dodges

This is not intended to be a definitive list, especially when it comes to aircraft models. Where the same model of aircraft is made by several manufacturers I won't always have the correct one. If you thought it was a Beechcraft King Air 200 and actually it was a Textron Super King Air B200GT, I won't be losing any sleep. There are other data sources (see below) if you want absolute accuracy.
